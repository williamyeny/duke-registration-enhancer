# Duke Registration Enhancer

Chrome extension that enhances Dukehub's registration page by changing the page's appearance and adding features. [Download it here!](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/duke-registration-enhance/ahlkcnepemhengifaokogcgbfggpkjmk) Developed by Will Ye and Shamikh Hossain.

## Disclaimers

- This is a temporary extension. Eventually, the entire Duke registration site will be overhauled, be it in 6 months or 6 years. When that happens, the entire extension will be obsolete and need to be disabled or completely changed.

- This may unintentionally break functionality. There could be certain not well known features of the registration page that only a few students use. I cannot test every single button, so there is an unlikely possibility things may break.

- This may intentionally break functionality. There might be buttons I believe absolutely no one uses, so I will remove or change them. HOWEVER, if you actually miss them, please don't hesitate to contact me.

## Testing

To test the extension, go to `chrome://extensions`, enable developer mode and load unpacked extension. Select the `extension` folder.

To test the lambda server, please check out the [Serverless Quick Start guide](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/quick-start/).

Note: lambda server is not being used ATM
